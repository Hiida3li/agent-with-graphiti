      "**Silas Blackwood, 58, was as much a fixture of the towering cliff-edge lighthouse as the very lamp itself.** His solitude wasn't imposed, but chosen – a quiet, almost monastic devotion to the rhythmic flash and the ceaseless churn of the sea. The world beyond the waves had, long ago, proven too loud, too sharp, leaving scars he preferred to keep unmolested by human touch. His days were a precise ballet of polished brass, refilled oil, and weathered logs in the stove; his only companions were the gulls, the wind, and the ghosts of forgotten ships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, during a tempestuous squall that rattled the very foundations of his solitary sanctuary, a sodden, leather-bound cylinder washed ashore, snagging on the rocks below his perch. Inside, unfurled by his calloused fingers, lay a map unlike any he’d ever seen – not of coasts or currents, but of impossible symbols, a labyrinthine path, and a single, faded X that seemed to pulse with an ancient, forgotten light.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an alien intrusion, a whisper of a world he’d meticulously shut out. For years, Silas had been the keeper of the light, warning others away from danger. Now, a strange, undeniable urge tugged him *towards* an unknown darkness, a destination that promised to shatter the serene quiet he’d so carefully constructed. The map was a challenge, a potential curse, and perhaps, a final, dangerous call to a life he thought he’d long abandoned.\n"
