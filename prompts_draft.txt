description="Use this tool to send responses to the user in two phases.
PHASE 1 (Direct Response): Send an immediate greeting, acknowledgment message telling the user their request is being processed (e.g., 'I'll help you find that product, let me search for you...').
PHASE 2 (Final Result): After executing other tools, use this tool again to deliver the comprehensive results and findings to the user.
Make it a human-like interaction where users get immediate response followed by detailed answers."


description="Use this tool to respond to the user in two distinct phases:
PHASE 1 (Immediate Acknowledgment): Send a friendly, human-like message to greet the user and acknowledge their request. Let them know their request is being processed (e.g., "Got it! I’ll look that up for you now…").
PHASE 2 (Follow-up with Results): After executing the appropriate tools, use this tool again to deliver the results back to the user in a helpful and natural way.
This tool is used twice in the flow, to provide immediate acknowledgment and improve responsiveness, and to share final results once retrieved.
Ensure the responses feel conversational, human, and context-aware."
